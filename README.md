## Notes

- I also found it challenging having to plan out how to modify my code to use the React Router and the logic I needed to accomplish the requirements.

## Notes

- I had a lot of challenges styling the app and getting bootstrap set up.
- I initially wanted to use a different API, but I ran into a CORS issue, which I was unable to resolve. This has intrigued me into researching how to fix the issue. I would've put more effort into resolving it, but I'm limited on time to turn this in, so I chose a different API.
- I also found it difficult planning how to tackle building this application.
